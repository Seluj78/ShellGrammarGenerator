#### Contributing

I'm far from being a shell/C expert and suspect there are many ways to improve this converterâ€“ if you have ideas on how to make the ShellGrammarConverter easier to maintain (and faster), don't hesitate to fork and send pull requests!

You can also take a look through the open issues and help where you can.
